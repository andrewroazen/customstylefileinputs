# customstylefileinputs
A few improvements to @osvaldasvalutis Custom Style file inputs, based on code from https://tympanus.net/codrops/2015/09/15/styling-customizing-file-inputs-smart-way/

Improvements: 
- Now a single event bound to document instead of manually instantiated per instance
- Blocks upload of a file over maximum filesize in bytes
